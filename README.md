### Hello!
<p>
 I'm a self-taught AI enthusiast, currently a Research Scholar at IIIT, Bangalore. My area of research broadly falls into the category of AI Safety. Working with various kinds of CNNs. I am generally interested in the Safety, Alignment and Privacy considerations of AI. Other than that, I have a great deal of interest in the field of Complex, Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems, along with Cellular Automata and Artificial Life. I enjoy learning about ideas that occur at the confluence of two or more fields, Neural Networks are a prime example of that. There are a lot of unorthodox ideas that do not neatly fit into specialist boxes and have the capacity to be entirely revolutionary all on their own. Above all, I love venturing into subjects that narrate a great story. I love hearing well-told, intriguing stories.
</p>

<p>
 I primarily code in Python, sometimes C. I keep switching between Windows and Linux based on what I need to do, most of which is done through the terminal. I like implementing theoretical models, running simulations and being surprised by unexpected results. I am enthusiastic about space exploration and planes. Heavier-than-air flying-machines has to be one of the best inventions of mankind, closely following thinking machines.
</p>

<p>
I enjoy sketching and writing when I'm not trying to work, I enjoy sketching more as I have a veritable pile of manuscripts that are in a perpetual state of disrepair. Besides that, I do enjoy reading too, although the amount of books that I used to read on a yearly basis has drastically reduced. I mostly like to read Julian Jaynes, John Searle, Wittgenstein, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Hegel and the like; I would also like to believe that I understand atleast some of it.
</p>

<p>
 You can read more about my random musing at my bearblog page <a href="https://sykchw.bearblog.dev/">electric brains ðŸ§ </a>. Still in its nascent stages, it is a messy personal blog that mostly has byte sized chunks of some technical exposition along with a lot of unrelated stuff that comes to my mind. You are just as likely to see a poem about cobblers next to analyses of particular convex sets.
</p>

<p>
 You can also check out my <a href="https://sykchw.github.io/">Research Blog</a> that has more long-form technical content.
